  My favourite song is Jigsaw Falling Into Place, by Radiohead, my favourite band.
  I mostly listen to rock, pop, and jazz. Some other artists I like are John Mayer, Laufey, Blur, Olivia Rodrigo,
  Julian Lage, Pat Metheny, Wes Montgomery, Ella Fitzgerald, Pink Floyd, Tom Waits, Queen, and The Smile.</p>

  I have been taking guitar lessons since spring of 2019 with a local musician named Lucas Haneman. Give his band, the
  Lucas Haneman Express, a listen!
