                    I began by picking out my pieces. I tried my best to pick flat, straight ones as many were warped or had imperfections.
                    I started with the pieces for the main sides and the bottom. There is a large pile in the tech room of pieces to
                    choose from, but I needed pieces that were 1 inch thick, while the pieces in the tech room were only ¾ of an inch
                    thick. Mr. Doherty brought pieces from another room, which were all pretty flat and long, and thick enough for my box.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This time, I didn't really need to do any drawing or marking on the pieces because many had the same dimensions and the
                    table and mitre saws could cut them precisely and uniformly without the help of drawings/measurements on the wood. I
                    basically just measured the large pieces and figured out how many of what kind of piece I would be able to cut from it
                    based off of the dimensions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During this time, I also picked out some of the pieces for my trim, but I later realized that it was a different kind of
                    wood, so I ended up having to redo those pieces from another piece of wood that was the same type as the rest of my box.

                    I first used the table saw to cut all the long pieces to the correct width, then used the mitre saw to cut the resulting boards
                    to the correct lengths. Since many of the pieces were the same, I first measured and cut one to the correct length, and then used
                    that initial one to line up and cut the rest of the pieces to the exact same length. I left a little bit of excess (e.g. if I needed a 12
                    inch long piece, I'd cut it to 12.25 inches) on the length of the pieces to leave some room for inevitable error during the gluing process,
                    after which I could still cut the edge flat while still keeping the correct length. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mr. Doherty did the cutting with the table saw. He adjusted the height of the table saw and the distance of the fence to what I needed, then
                    pushed it through with his hands and then a wooden push stick, keeping a straight edge flat with the fence. For the mitre saw, I measured and
                    marked using a pencil the desired length (as I said, leaving some excess), then pushed the wood flat against the guide, lined up the saw blade
                    (making sure to cut on the outside of the line to account for the thickness of the blade), held it in place, and cut the initial piece. I then
                    used this initial piece to line up and cut all the pieces that were the same length, and then repeated this process for subsequent pieces.

                    After that, I scored each side that would be glued using a chisel—that is, I made little X’s on the wood using
                    the sharp point of the chisel. I believe the purpose of this was to make the glue be absorbed and adhere to the
                    wood better and more easily. I tried my best not to go all the way to the edges to avoid damaging the sides of
                    the wood.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then came the gluing itself. I placed the wood into 2 parallel loosened clamps. One by one, I took a piece,
                    applied some glue along the side to be glued using the bottle, spread it evenly using a short, thin piece of
                    used excess wood, repeated for the other side if necessary, and replaced it into the clamps. Once all the pieces
                    had glue, I tightened the clamps at the same time so that it would be even. I made sure to keep the pieces flat
                    and properly aligned, as well as putting the clamps on the very edges of the wood, to prevent unevenness and
                    splitting. I wiped the extra glue being squeezed out on the top and bottom with a paper towel, and then put
                    'one more clamp in the middle and a weight or two on top of the wood to keep it flat. I repeated this process,
                    doing one face per day (we didn’t have that many clamps). I think Mr. Doherty removed the wood from the clamps
                    later in the day after the class. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once each face was finished gluing, I scraped off any glue I could using an upside-down chisel (upside-down to
                    avoid damaging the wood), then cut the sides flat using the table saw. I first cut off a tiny bit on one side to
                    get a straight edge, then lined it up using the straight edge and cut the other side to the desired width. The
                    excess length I had left on the pieces left me with just enough to keep the correct dimensions. Between classes,
                    Mr. Doherty put the faces through the thickness planer in the other room to smooth out the pieces and get them all
                    the same thickness. The last 2 images in the carousel below especially show the difference before and after being
                    thickness planed.

                    This was also a pretty simple joint. Using the same process as the mitre joint, I used the mitre saw to cut 
                    off 2 inches of the long piece, this time at a 90° angle instead.

                  <p>
                    I also used the drill press to drill a small hole in the side of the small piece, which would later be used
                    for a screw.

                  <p>
                    Then, at the very end once everything was sanded, I glued and used a screw to secure the butt joint in place.
                    I first drilled a little hole for the screw through the short piece, where the previously made hole was. I then 
                    spread some carpenting glue using my finger on the end of the long piece where it would meet the short one,
                    then put them together tightly in a vise. My friend Muhammad helped me to make sure they were straight and flush
                    together. After, I used an electric screwdriver to put a screw through the small hole and into the longer piece.
                    I then put some glue in the hole and filled it in with wooden plug. Once the glue was dried, I moved it in the 
                    vise and cut off the excess plug using a hand saw. Finally, I sanded the whole area including the plug until it was
                    smooth. The two pieces of the butt joint were now firmly joined together.

                    The dovetail was one of, if not the, most complex joints to create. First, we created the ‘inside’ parts of 
                    the joints (the parts on the small piece in the middle that would fit into the part we’d cut out in the 
                    long pieces). We did this in two steps: we cut out the diagonal cuts using the band saw and a jig that lined 
                    up the angle and distance for us (see image) so we simply had to push it straight through the saw, and then 
                    we cut out the horizontal parts which were just at a 90° angle (once again using the band saw). For that 
                    second step, we had to use a push stick to push the dovetail in and push the piece that was cut off out of 
                    the way, for safety purposes and so that the piece didn’t get jammed and possibly break the saw.

                    Afterwards, I created the ‘outside’ parts of the joints, where the inside parts would sit. I traced the inside 
                    parts onto the long pieces of wood, making sure to line them up properly, put the wood tightly inside a vise, 
                    and then began cutting with a hand saw. I first made two cuts halfway through the thickness of the wood on the 
                    lines where I traced, which marked the sides of the joint. Because of the nature of the joint, we had to use a 
                    process where we cut out numerous parallel cuts between the two initial cuts, creating little ‘slices’ that we 
                    would later pry out with a chisel to create the actual shape (see images). I did my best to keep the cuts on 
                    the lines, straight down, and exactly to the halfway line. Then, using a chisel, I pried out the ‘slices’ and 
                    chiseled out the remainder of the joint. During this process, I kept the chisel pretty much flat, I kept two 
                    hands on it, and I only went halfway through before going from the other direction so as to not tear off any 
                    of the wood on the other side. I made the joint as flat as I could so that the dovetail would fit snugly and 
                    precisely inside.

                    Finally, I traced the thickness that I needed to cut out from the inside dovetail so that it’d fit properly 
                    in the outside part. I adjusted the table saw to the correct height and then used it to cut out the bottom 
                    half of the dovetail bit by bit. It was adjusted so that at the last cut, I could just align it and then hold 
                    it tightly while pushing it through the saw so that it would be at exactly the 2 inches that I needed to cut 
                    off. Once this was done, I chiseled the outer part a little bit more so that it would fit correctly, finishing 
                    the dovetail.

                    This was also a fairly complex joint. Because of the tech room we were in, it wasn’t wasn’t ideal to make 
                    the mortise. First, I made the approximate shape of the mortise using the drill press. It unfortunately 
                    moved a little bit as I wasn’t holding the wood tight enough, so it didn’t go all the way down at one end, 
                    but I could just chisel that away after. I then put the wood tightly in a vise and then used a sharp chisel 
                    and a rubber mallet to chisel out the remainder of the shape as well as what I missed when I was using the 
                    drill press. I had to change to a different vise because the one I was originally using wasn’t tight enough, 
                    and the wood just moved when I used the mallet and chisel. After a lot of work, I chiseled out the final 
                    shape of the mortise, making the corners sharp and the bottom flat.

                  <p>
                    Next, I made the tenon. I measured the height of the mortise, then adjusted the table saw using the measurement. 
                    Using the same process as the dovetail, I cut out the bottom and top of the tenon. Then, I did the same thing but
                    with the width of the mortise and the sides of the tenon. I also measured the depth of the mortise using a ruler and
                    drew a corresponding line on the tenon. 
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Finally, I cut off the marked part on the end using the mitre saw. It didn't quite fit inside the mortise,
                    so I filed down some of the sides and the end of the tenon until it fit nicely.

                    I created the half lap using the same process as the last step of the dovetail joint and the tenon. The height of the table saw was set to 
                    ½” (half the thickness of the wood) and I cut the piece of wood bit by bit until I reached the 2 inches (again, it was 
                    adjusted so that I could line it up against the wall and have it exactly at the 2 inches). This process wasn’t really 
                    difficult; I just had to hold the wood tightly. It was the same for both pieces of the half lap. After cutting, I used a 
                    chisel to flatten out the cut a little bit, making sure not to change the depth or shape.

                      To finish the project, I first used the orbital sander to sand off the pencil and rougher parts. Then, I used a block of wood and some sandpaper
                      to sand it by hand until it was smooth, starting with 120 grit and then moving to 180. 
                      <br><br>
                      I'm pretty happy with the finished
                      project. Though there are some minor errors, overall, it turned out quite well. I definitely learned a lot about the various
                      types of wood joinery and it was a fun project to make. It used some different techniques and tools from the barbecue scraper,
                      and it was more difficult (though I had some more experience this time).
